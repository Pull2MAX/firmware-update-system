# Advanced Firmware Management System

## Overview

A sophisticated embedded firmware upgrade solution implementing secure OTA capabilities and fail-safe update mechanisms for mission-critical IoT devices. Built upon a dual-partition architecture that ensures operational continuity throughout the update lifecycle.

## Key Technologies

- **Multi-Channel Update Pathways**: Serial XMODEM, Secure MQTT OTA, and Offline Flash Storage
- **Robust Partitioning**: 64KB flash architecture with dedicated bootloader (20KB) and application (44KB) regions
- **Version Control System**: EEPROM-based version tracking with comprehensive metadata management
- **Security Implementation**: Integrity verification through signature validation and secure boot procedures
- **State Machine Architecture**: Deterministic update flow with fault tolerance and recovery mechanisms

## Technical Implementation

The system employs a state-driven approach to manage the entire firmware lifecycle, leveraging W25Q64 external flash for multi-version storage. Communication with the MQTT broker is established through cellular connectivity, enabling remote deployment across geographically distributed devices.
